# alfred-blbsearch

> An Alfred workflow for quickly searching the Bible using BlueLetterBible.org


## Install

Download the alfred workflow here: [alfred-blbsearch](https://github.com/mttjhn/alfred-blbsearch/blob/master/BlueLetterBibleSearch.alfredworkflow)

This workflow is super simple, taking your input and searching BlueLetterBible.org. This means you can easily look up a specific reference or search the Bible for a specific keyword. Currently the URL parameters are defaulted to search ESV, but you can change the workflow to use a different version.

## Usage

In Alfred, type `blb` and enter your query. This should open the BlueLetterBible.org website with your search results.
